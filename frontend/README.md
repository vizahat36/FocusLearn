# FocusLearn Frontend

This is the frontend for the FocusLearn project, built with ReactJS.

## Structure
- `src/` - React source code
- `public/` - Static assets

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

Note: I added a few dependencies (react-router-dom, axios, react-player, chart.js). If you're using TypeScript, also install the types:

```
npm install --save-dev @types/react @types/react-dom @types/react-router-dom
```

## Requirements
- Node.js 18+
- npm

## Build
```
npm run build
```
